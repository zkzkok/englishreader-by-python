# 起因是阅读英语文本阅读时，查单词读音很痛苦，尤其是查询该单词是否是考纲有多重要。所以参照蒙哥英语阅读器，课余时间写的一个按照颜色标记的英语阅读器，不同难度有不同颜色显示

# 输入区：把文本复制进入输入区会自动扫描

# 阅读区：左键点击生词可以显示翻译，中键生词发音，右键生词加入生词本
绿色：初高中
红色：四六级
紫色：雅思
具体分层级标注难度可以查阅源码，都有注释

# 缓冲区：生词本

# 日志区：显示程序运行状态

# 单词释义区：显示生词意思

ps：代码写的很乱，只是能用，纯粹是拿出来分享，使用请注明来源谢谢啦


# The reason is that when reading English texts, it is very painful to check the pronunciation of words, especially how important it is to check whether the word is in the exam syllabus. So, referring to the Mengge English Reader, I wrote an English reader in my spare time that is marked by color, with different difficulty levels displayed in different colors

# Reading area: Left click on new words to display translation, middle click on new word pronunciation, right click on new word to add to vocabulary book
